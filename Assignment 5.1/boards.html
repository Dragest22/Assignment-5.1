            1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, 
            connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and 
            security components in the design.<br><br>
            2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, 
            vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch 
            management, auditing and assessment.<br><br>
            3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as 
            installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, 
            analysis and assessment.<br><br>
            4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an 
            incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, 
            assessments or troubleshooting procedures.<br><br>
            5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements 
            that pertain to information security.<br><br>
            6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious 
            activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of 
            sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
